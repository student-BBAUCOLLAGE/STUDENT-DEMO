BBAU OVERVIEW -Established on June 16, 2016, the Satellite Center in Tikarmafi, Amethi, is an extension of BBAU, located 152 kilometers from Lucknow. Aligned with the University's mission, it aims to uplift education and economic prosperity, with a special focus on marginalized and underprivileged segments of society in Amethi and surrounding areas.

Initially, the Satellite Center offered three departments: Social Science & Commerce, Languages & Vocational Studies, and Computer Science & Information Technology. Today, these departments have been restructured and aligned with the University's main departments, encompassing Computer Science, Information Technology, Food & Nutrition, English, Commerce, History, Public Administration, Economics, and Sociology. These departments are integrated into their respective schools on the main campus.

In the realm of education, we believe that teachers guide both construction and destruction, but true enlightenment comes from education. Education shapes experts, professionals, and responsible citizens. The Satellite Center Amethi is dedicated to aligning with Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University's vision, fostering innovation, and advancing research. We offer various programs under the NEP 2020 scheme, led by accomplished faculty members, aiming to nurture a generation of knowledgeable and ethical individuals dedicated to societal betterment. Join us on this transformative journey towards a brighter future.
